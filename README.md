  Setup is necessary to initialize everything and to also set initial values, the loop is the actual code that will be executed over and   over again, this code is used to actually control the embedded system.

2.) Why does our code need to be compiled?

3.) When lowering the frequency in step four, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

Lowering the frequency causes a rapid flash on and off of the LED, since our eyes can see the changes of the led. In the real world
